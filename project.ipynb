    "Dried weight of plants is measured for all groups, the control group without the treatment and the groups with two different treatment types. There is no more information provided on conditions the plants were treated in except different treatment types. Assuming the rest of conditions were set equal for each group, we will analyse data solely based on different treatment types. The purpose of the project is to compare plant growth according to a treatment type using t-test and ANOVA statistical tests. By using these tests, we will try to determine is there a significant difference between the groups. Additionally, we will compare ANOVA and t-test approach in this particular dataset analysis. "

The paired t-test is used on the same subjects, for example to compare the results before and after the intervention on the same group of patients. The independent t-test, on the other hand, compares means of two unrelated groups, where the values of one group have no impact on the values in the other group in any sense. An example of this would be applying two types of treatments on patients where the values of one treatment does not relate to the values of the other treatment.  "
