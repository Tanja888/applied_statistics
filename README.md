# Applied Statistics 

The repository contains two Jupyter notebooks: `project.ipynb` and `tasks.ipynb` that include Python code in order to perform statistical analysis. 
The covered topics include:

  * Using `numpy`, `math`, `itertools`, `random` Python libraries to gain insight into statistical concepts of permutations and combinations
  * Test data normality using `numpy.random.normal()`  and Shapiro-Wilk test 
  * Compare two sets of data and their means by performing a t-test using `scipy` library
  * Understand how to perform ANOVA statistical test to compare more than two sets of values using `scipy`
  * Gain insight into concept of statistical errors by using an example of the Type II error while performing ANOVA test 
  * Visualise the outcomes of performed analysis with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

tasks.ipynb is consisted of four tasks:    

1. Permutations and Combinations     
2. numpy's Normal Distribution       
3. t-Test Calculation     
4. ANOVA
